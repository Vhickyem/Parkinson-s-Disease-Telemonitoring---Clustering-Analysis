# Parkinson's Disease Telemonitoring - A Clustering Analysis

## ðŸ“– Problem Background

**Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD)** is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects motor control. It is characterized by symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia (slower movements), and postural instability. Beyond these motor impairments, Parkinsonâ€™s disease also affects speech and voice. Patients frequently develop vocal abnormalities such as reduced loudness, monotone speech, breathiness, and imprecise articulation, collectively known as dysphonia. These voice changes often appear early and can serve as non-invasive biomarkers of disease progression.  

**Traditional monitoring of PD progression** relies on in-clinic assessments using the Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). While clinically validated, these assessments are costly, time-consuming, and limited to infrequent hospital visits. This creates gaps in continuous disease monitoring and can delay the timely adjustment of treatment plans.  

To address this challenge, researchers have explored remote telemonitoring systems that capture patientsâ€™ voice samples in their own homes. Such systems provide frequent, low-cost, and non-invasive monitoring of speech-related symptoms. These systems provide the opportunity to be able to technically assess information on the different *subgroups of patients with similar vocal biomarkers*, *distinct trajectories of disease progression*, *natural groupings of voice recordings that reflect different stages of motor impairment*, etc.  

By identifying these clusters, researchers and clinicians can gain deeper insight into how Parkinsonâ€™s manifests across individuals. This may enable personalized treatment strategies, earlier identification of patients at risk of rapid progression, and the development of non-invasive voice-based monitoring tools that complement traditional clinical assessments.
